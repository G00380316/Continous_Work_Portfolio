Continuous Work

The first part, "Continuous Work," involves creating a portfolio of all the work we did over the semester and then creating a video to explain each piece of work you created.

Next, you will create a project. The project requires you to research pipelines to build a microservice, create slides to explain your project, produce a video using your slides and present your project,
and then explain and demonstrate how the code works.

Next, you will create a reflective essay explaining what was involved in your Continuous Work. You will explain how you did your work, what you learned, discuss the challenges, and what has changed in your approach.
